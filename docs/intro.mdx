## Overview

The Pokémon TCG API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use the Pokémon TCG API without registering for an API key, although your limits are far less than if you had an API key. The API key you use to authenticate the request determines your rate limits. Register for an api key at the [Developer Portal](https://dev.pokemontcg.io).

You can use this documentation to get familiar with the REST API or any of the supported developer SDKs, such as Python, Ruby and more.
